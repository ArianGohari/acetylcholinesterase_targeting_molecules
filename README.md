# Exploratory analysis of bioactivity data of Acetylcholinesterase targeting molecules
R Shiny Application for exploratory data analysis of bioactivity of Acetylcholinesterase targeting molecules.
The dataset contains pIC50 values for each compound, their resulting bioactivity class (“active” or “inactive”) and the 4 Lipinski descriptors. Boxplots and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests were used in order to analyze the relationship between each descriptor and the bioactivity class. A Scatterplot of the molecular weights against Log P indicates a moderate positive correlation.
